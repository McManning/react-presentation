Note:
- On memory management: this is not PHP. Your application is going to be long running, and as such, you need to start thinking about memory usage and (de)allocation.
- Shibboleth timeouts are going to break your AJAX requests for long running apps. You need to start thinking about how to handle it. (I promise there will be future discussions on this).
